# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

Working with real-world data means working with messy data.
This project focuses on the practical steps involved in preparing raw datasets for meaningful analysis.

Instead of jumping straight into modeling or visualization, the goal here is to understand how to assess, clean, transform, and organize data properly.

 What This Project Covers
## 1️⃣ Data Gathering

The process begins with collecting raw data from available sources (such as CSV files).
At this stage, the data is usually unstructured and contains various quality issues.

## 2️⃣ Data Assessment

Before making any changes, the dataset is explored to understand:

Missing values

Incorrect data types

Duplicates

Outliers

General inconsistencies

Libraries like Pandas and NumPy are used to inspect and evaluate the data.

## 3️⃣ Data Cleaning

Real datasets often contain errors that can negatively affect analysis.

Key cleaning steps include:

✔ Handling Missing Values
Using techniques like removal, mean/median imputation, or forward/backward filling.

✔ Outlier Detection & Treatment
Outliers are identified using:

Visualizations (boxplots, histograms)

IQR method

Z-score method

✔ Removing Duplicates
Ensuring that repeated records do not bias results.

## 4️⃣ Data Transformation

To improve analysis and model performance:

✔ Normalization / Scaling

StandardScaler

Log Transformation

These techniques help stabilize variance and reduce skewness.

## 5️⃣ Data Organization

Final touches to improve usability:

✔ Creating new columns (feature engineering)
✔ Renaming columns for clarity

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn
